title: YouScope R2018 (v2.1.0) released
---
<p>We finally released YouScope R2018! What was originally planned as R2017 was finally released after extensive testing and bugfixing. There are many new features, and many more to come. The Version should be downwards compatible to the last version and thus run on all microscopes already running some not completely outdated version of YouScope. Have fun!
