 -= Running CellX on the Cluster =- 
   --==========================--


This directory contains a test perl script (submit.pl) for parallelization 
of CellX on a cluster. This how-to is specific for the SGE cluster/grid
that is running in our department (BSSE), however, should be adaptable to 
other cluster environments without much effort. 

Requirements for the cluster system are

- a shared filesystem where images and results are saved 
- a qsub program (provided e.g. by SGE or Torque/PBS)

On the head node:

- Perl with xml modules libxml-perl libxml-dom-perl libxml-regexp-perl
- java 1.6

On the compute nodes:

- Matlab compiler runtime MCR


Login to the cluster with ssh -X bs-submit...


1) Ensure that the following commands are 
   the last lines in your .bash_profile 

   module load repo/grid
   module load grid/grid

   unset BSSE_SGE

2) Copy the CellX linux files 
   (the MCR is already installed at /usr/local/bsse/MCR/v715)
   to a folder in your cluster home


3) Copy the images to the cluster file system 

4) Run 
   
   java -jar CellXGui.jar 
   
   and configure your job as usual.


5) Save the parameters to a file config.xml (File -> Export Parameters)


6) Save the file series to a file series.xml (File -> Export File Series)


7) Run 

   ./submit.pl config.xml params.xml [INDEX-OF-SERIES]


8) When all jobs have finished, run

   ./runTracker.sh
