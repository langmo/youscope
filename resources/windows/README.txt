The YouScope exe files are build using launch4j, which can be downloaded at http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/
The exes are built automatically by the build script - no more action is needed.
However, to build them stand alone, we here conveniently also provide the corresponding configuration (XML) files.

There are two exes, one for 32bit and one for 64bit. The configurations of these files are
YouScope32.xml
YouScope64.xml

Additionally, there are also the config files of the old jsmooth build, which can be downloaded at http://jsmooth.sourceforge.net/
These are only working for 32bit, and are a little bit outdated.
The config file for jsmooth is
YouScope.jsmooth.
